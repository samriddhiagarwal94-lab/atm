# 🏧 Student ATM Project (C Language)

A simple console-based ATM simulation built using C programming language.  
This project demonstrates basic banking operations along with PIN security and transaction history tracking.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 First-time PIN setup
- 🔑 Secure login with 3 attempts
- 💰 Balance enquiry
- ➕ Deposit money
- ➖ Withdraw money
- 📜 Transaction history (stores last 10 transactions)
- 🔄 Change PIN option
- 🚪 Exit system safely

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C Programming
- Arrays
- Loops (while, for)
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Functions of stdio.h

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. User creates a PIN (first-time setup).
2. User logs in using PIN (3 attempts allowed).
3. After successful login, ATM menu is displayed:
   - Balance enquiry
   - Deposit
   - Withdraw
   - Transaction history
   - Change PIN
   - Exit

Transaction history stores up to 10 records using arrays.
